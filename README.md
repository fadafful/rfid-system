# RFID System

This is an old sample project with Angular and Arduino for an RFID system.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (for Angular)
- Composer (for PHP dependencies)
- Arduino IDE (for Arduino code)

## Installation

### Angular Frontend

1. Navigate to the Angular project directory:
    ```sh
    cd path/to/angular-project
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the Angular development server:
    ```sh
    ng serve
    ```

### PHP Backend

1. Navigate to the PHP project directory:
    ```sh
    cd path/to/php-project
    ```

    composer install
    ```

3. Install the Firebase JWT library:
    ```sh
    composer require firebase/php-jwt
    ```

### Arduino

1. Open the Arduino IDE.
2. Connect your Arduino board to your computer.
3. Open the Arduino sketch file for the RFID system.
4. Install any required libraries for the RFID system.
5. Upload the sketch to the Arduino board.
